# QML-Integration-with-cpp
Example code integrating QML and C++ using qmlRegisterType and Q_PROPERTY methods.

This code is based on a tutorial posted to the official Qt Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e35ugcY2aOk) that of course didn't include the source code for download. I've done my best to hand copy the code that was shown, and then fill in the blanks where needed. 

# To Build
This builds/runs in Qt 6.3 on MacOS, but would likely also work with previous versions.
